JForum is in constant development and improvement, and we always try to ship the best code possible.


## Libraries ##

Some libraries have been changed from JForum 2.3.2 to version 2.3.3, and they are necessary to have the software running smoothly. Please make sure that no duplicated version of such exist in the WEB-INF/lib directory, as it would cause some strange runtime behavior.
